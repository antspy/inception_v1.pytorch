# inception_v1.pytorch
An implementation of inception_v1 on pytorch with pretrained weights. 

This code is a pytorch translation of the soumith torch repo: https://github.com/soumith/inception.torch
It implements the original version of the inception architechture; what is known has GoogLeNet.

# Disclaimer 
I have not tested the resulting accuracy on imagenet, so there could be a bug in the implementation or the loading of the weights. If you use this and see that it works, please let me know! :-)
